This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for power plant production. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

This workbook documents a content model for reporting electrical power production. In the context of NGDS, these will normally be geothermal power plants, but the content model is not unique to a single power plant type.  Source: http://www.nbmg.unr.edu/lists/Production/index.html

There are currently no services deployed using this information exchange.
